# Lipo_Charger_PCB
I have worked on a project in which I have to design a lipo Battery Charging circuit for Larus Som.
I have created input and output Pads to connect Lipo battery and for power supply.
There is reverse polarity protection for lithium ion battery.
It is a two layer PCB and the size of this PCB is 30x24mm.
